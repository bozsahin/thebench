This folder contains various grammars and TheBench commands to process them.

Naming convention for the files:

<code>.txt</code> The grammar text file

<code>.basic.log</code> Basic categories and features of the grammar

<code>.skeleton.log</code> All distinct categories of the grammar and list of items bearing them

<code>.tbc</code> TheBench commands to process the grammar. The naming convention is:

   - <code>sc.no</code>  : no synthetic case rule derived or used

   - <code>sc.all</code> : synthetic case rules derived and used in all analyses

   - <code>sc.nf</code>  : synthetic case rules derived and used in normal form analysis only (i.e. reporting one analysis among equivalents)
                  
<code>.session</code> The output of a command file (usually suffixed with <code>.log</code>)

<code>.arules</code> The derived entries of synthetic case (by 'c command')

The command files explain how they are obtained.
